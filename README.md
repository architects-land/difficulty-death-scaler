# Difficulty Death Scaler

A fabric mod scaling difficulty on number of death like Demon's Soul.

When a player dies, the mod increases the difficulty.

After 12 hours, if no one has died, or if you killed a boss, the difficulty is reset to the previous stage.
If you were at 8 deaths, the mod will forget 3 deaths, and you will now be at 5 deaths.
