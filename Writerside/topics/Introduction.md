# Introduction

[Difficulty Death Scaler](https://modrinth.com/mod/difficulty-death-scaler) is a server-side fabric mod modifying the 
difficulty of Minecraft.
It is a punishing mod which increases difficulty when you die, like Demon's Soul.
If you don't die during a long time, the difficulty will be progressively reduced.

This mod was made for server.
