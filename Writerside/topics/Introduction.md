# Introduction

Difficulty Death Scaler is a server-side fabric mod modifying the difficulty of Minecraft.
It is a punishing mod which increases difficulty when you die, like Demon's Soul.
If you don't die during a long time, the difficulty will be progressively reduced.

This mod was made for server.
It works on singleplayer, but it was designed to be played in multiplayer.
